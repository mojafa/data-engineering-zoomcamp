## Question 4. Github Storage Block

Using the `web_to_gcs` script from the videos as a guide, you want to store your flow code in a GitHub repository for collaboration with your team. Prefect can look in the GitHub repo to find your flow code and read it. Create a GitHub storage block from the UI or in Python code and use that in your Deployment instead of storing your flow code locally or baking your flow code into a Docker image.

Note that you will have to push your code to GitHub, Prefect will not push it for you.

Run your deployment in a local subprocess (the default if you donâ€™t specify an infrastructure). Use the Green taxi data for the month of November 2020.
